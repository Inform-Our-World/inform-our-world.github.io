<h1 style=margin-left:15px>Mahesh trapped in the dream.</h1>
<hr style=width:20%;height:5px;border-radius:10px;background:rgba(0,0,255,.247);border:0;margin-left:30px>
<p style=text-align:left>Train was 1hr late; they had reached Raurkela Jn, Odisha and were entering Jharkhand. A silent was occurring in the train, many passengers had stepped down before Raurkela. There were none other than Saqha and Mahesh In the coach. A strange feeling was surrounded with a small piece of sleeping environment. But, however that small piece became 90% of strange feeling. Confused na? Let me make it more sensible. Saqha and Mahesh were feeling sleepy. Saqha slept and Mahesh also. But, there weren’t 2 people present in the coach; a third man was watching their behavior. Who was that?
</p>

<h1 style=margin-left:15px>On the way of truth</h1>
<hr style=width:20%;height:5px;border-radius:10px;background:rgba(0,0,255,.247);border:0;margin-left:30px>
<p style=text-align:left>Mahesh opened his eyes. He saw that he is in a plateau. The plateau that was barren, insufficient with water. Mahesh’s mouth had become arid. Mahesh on that barren land, full of thirst, he couldn’t think of anything. After walking a mile, he saw a big mountain. That mountain was very much different. A line was going through the mountain vertically at half. It seems that it was a door. Mahesh was astonished. A big door like this, Mahesh haven’t seen this type of thing in his entire life. But the truth is in front of his eyes. Before he can thought of more, the door opened automatically. Mahesh, who was tired, not only tired, a way too much tired, entered without thinking. Without a second, the attack started. He saw a sharp blade, big enough coming towards him, he ran to a safer place or else the condition would be of those who had entered there before and were killed by that blade. Mahesh could saw red blood spreading all over the floor and on the side of him; he could saw bones of people. It was a scary moment. The next was of the ‘pairo tale jameen khisakna ’ or ‘Slipping off of ground’ , a hindi phrase, meaning amazed. But it was happening in real i.e the ground was being destroyed. Mahesh totally lose his mind. He ran off, I think faster than Usain Bolt. After passing this ‘level’ he walked again, now it was the time for the water to attack Mahesh. As Mahesh was walking, he was thinking how could he get out of this curse, after a while, he noticed that something ‘liquidy’ is touching his toes. Afterwards, he noticed that the water is rising; he wants water but didn’t want water that may drown him. He ran away from there. Running n Running, as fast as Mahesh was going, the water level was rising. As Mahesh reached the end, the water had completely filled that den. It was Mahesh’s luck that he escaped out or else he would be drowned to death! A deep voice came from behind “You didn’t killed her. If you don’t, she will know the truth. You have to kill her or I will not forgive you like this one.”
<p>“Who are you??” asked Mahesh
<p>“Uh ha. Who is this? Is it Mahesh or not?” asked that speaker
<p>“Ya, I am” said Mahesh
<p>“Uhhh.. I bought older Mahesh, I will not forgive you coz you now know the truth.” Said speaker
<p>“What?? What are you saying?” said Mahesh till he knew that he had reached in a blank space, some force was acting upon his eyelids and gradually closed his eyes with eyelids. When he opened his eyes, he saw himself in the coach
<p>“What just happened!!!” asked Mahesh
<p>“He.. what are you telling??” asked Saqha in astonished way.
</p>

<h1 style=margin-left:15px>A new character comes in</h1>
<hr style=width:20%;height:5px;border-radius:10px;background:rgba(0,0,255,.247);border:0;margin-left:30px>
<p style=text-align:left>Mahesh explained all the things with Saqha.
<p>“So these are the things” said Saqha
<p>“Ya” said Mahesh
<p>“Now he is attacking you also.” said Saqha
<p>“I don’t think so. I think that my younger self is working for someone.” said Mahesh
<p>“He…. What are saying??” asked Saqha
<p>“At the end. Someone said that I didn’t do the work given by him. I think it relates to your dream” said Mahesh
<p>“But why??” asked Saqha
<p>“Don’t know.” said Mahesh
<p>“How did you know then?” asked Saqha
<p>“I feel it.” said Mahesh
<p>“Really? Leave it. I’m going to washroom” asked Saqha
<p>Saqha went to washroom, but it wasn’t nice for her.
<p>“AAAA….” Screamed Saqha
<p>“What happened” asked Mahesh in astonishment.
<p>“S.. Sorry I saw a graveyard outside.” apologized Saqha
<p>“Eh… ” Mahesh went to the seat.
<p>“AAAA…” Saqha screamed again
<p>“Wha… No no… she likely saw any other graveyard” muttered Mahesh
<p>“Bhaiya! Help!!!” screamed Saqha
<p>“UH… WHAT HAPPENED???” asked Mahesh
<p>Mahesh saw a person who was holding knife and was forcing Saqha to go to the dead end of the gate of the coach.
<p>“Hey! Stop!!!” said Mahesh
<p>“Wait he is just a hologram” said a Saint who was coming from another coach.
<p>“What??” asked Saqha.
<p>“See” the saint hovered on that figure
<p>“Oh ya he is.” said Mahesh
<p>“But how could you know??” asked Saqha
<p>“See. There is a projector on the top.” Said the Saint
<p>“Who placed there??” asked Mahesh
<p>“Who knows??” said the saint. “I came here to solve a problem.”
<p>“What problem??” asked both of them
<p>“Related to your parent.” Said the saint
<p>“But how could you know??” asked Saqha
<p>“I was in that bus also.” Said the saint
<p>“But the..” as Saqha was speaking, the saint said in between,
<p>“Ah! Don’t believe the newspaper articles. There were 4 people in total who survived.” Said the saint
<p>Is the saint telling the truth? Why did he know about their parent? Why would he help them?? We will know about this in the next chapter.
